'''
 This is a processed RNAseq dataset involving reading in quantitated gene expression data from an RNA-seq experiment, exploring the data using base R functions and then interpretation. 
 The dataset contains an experiment between a diseased cell line and diseased cell lines treated with compound X.
 The difference in expression change between the two health status is computed as Fold change to log 2 (Log2FC) and the significance of each is computed in p-value.

'''
 1. EMILIN2 (Elastin Microfibril Interfacer 2): is an extracellular matrix protein that plays a crucial role in anchoring smooth muscle cells to elastic fibers, contributing to the formation and assembly of blood vessels.
 2. POU3F4 (POU Class 3 Homeobox 4):is a transcription factor involved in the development of the inner ear and certain neural tissues. Mutations in this gene are associated with X-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss.
 3. LOC285954:refers to a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) whose specific function is not well-characterized. However, some studies suggest it may play a role in tumor suppression and regulation of cell proliferation.
 4. VEPH1 (Ventricular Zone Expressed PH Domain-Containing 1):is believed to be involved in neurodevelopment, particularly in the formation of the ventricular zone during brain development.
 5. DTHD1 (Death Domain-Containing 1):contains a death domain, suggesting a role in apoptotic processes.

# What are the functions of the top 5 downregulated genes.
head(Assignment1[order(Assignment1$pvalue) & Assignment1$diffexpressed == 'DOWN', ])

'''
 1. TBX5 (T-box transcription factor 5): is a transcription factor crucial for the development of the heart and upper limbs during embryonic growth.
 2. IFITM1 (Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 1): is part of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein family and plays a role in the immune response against viral infections.
 3. LAMA2 (Laminin Subunit Alpha 2):encodes the alpha-2 chain of laminin, a protein essential for the structural scaffolding of basement membranes in various tissues.
 4. CAV2 (Caveolin 2): encodes caveolin-2, a protein integral to the formation of caveolaeâ€”small invaginations on the cell membrane involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, lipid regulation, and endocytosis.
 5. TNN (Tenascin N):encodes tenascin-N, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in tissue development and repair. It plays a role in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, particularly within the nervous system and during wound healing.
